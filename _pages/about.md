I am an Assistant Professor in Computing at the National College of Ireland where I research and teach data science and AI concepts and their applications. Whilst receiving training as an Electronics Engineer I developed an interest in robot navigation and spatial data mapping, eventually leading me to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science at University College Dublin with a focus on automated mapping. Next, I explored the applications of spatial data and mathematical modelling to pandemic preparedness and response as a postdoctoral researcher at the Insight Centre, University of Galway.

Before my current role at the National College of Ireland,I also served as a Lecturer in Computing at Dublin City University and worked onground for their MSc in Data Analytics programme at Princess Nourah University in Saudi Arabia.
