I am an Assistant Professor in Computing at the National College of Ireland where I research and teach data science and AI methods and applications. I received training in Electronics Engineering from the Aligarh Muslim University and developed an interest in robot navigation and spatial data mapping. This led me to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science at University College Dublin with a focus on volunteered geographic information and automated mapping. As a postdoctoral researcher at the Insight, University of Galway, I explored the applications of spatial data modelling to pandemic preparedness and response.

Before my current role at the National College of Ireland,I worked as a Lecturer in Computing at Dublin City University and worked onground for their MSc in Data Analytics programme at Princess Nourah University in Saudi Arabia.
